# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions 

## Tasks:
* -0. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

* -1. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

* -2. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

* -3. Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

* -4. Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

* -5. Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

* -6. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

* -7. Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

* -8. Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

* -9. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

* -10. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

* -11. Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

* -12. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

* -13. Technical interview preparation: Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
