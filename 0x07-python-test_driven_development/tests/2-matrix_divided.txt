How to use the ``2-matrix_divided`` module
==========================================

Contains the function ``matrix_divided``
----------------------------------------

First import matrix_divided from 2-matrix_divided:
	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

The ``matrix_divided`` function divides all elements of a matrix by any number,
div. It returns a matrix of the same size with elements rounded to 2 decimal
places.

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[3, 6, 9],
	...	[12, 15, 18],
	...	[21, 24, 27]
	... ]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]]

	>>> matrix_divided([[2, 4], [6, 8]], 3)
	[[0.67, 1.33], [2.0, 2.67]]

	>>> matrix_divided([[]], 2)
	[[]]

The matrix must be a list of lists ``[[], []]`` of integers or floats,
otherwise a TypeError is raised.

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[3, 6, 9],
	...	(12, 15, 18),
	...	'21, 24, 27'
	... ]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[3, 6, 9],
	...	['a', 'b', 'c'],
	...	[21, 24, 27]
	... ]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

	>>> matrix = None
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Each row of the matrix must be of the same of the size, otherwise a TypeError
is raised.

	>>> matrix = [
	...	[1, 2, 3],
	...	[4, 5, 6, 7]
	... ]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

The number to divided by, div, must be an integer or float, otherwise a
TypeError is raised.

	>>> matrix_divided([[2, 4], [6, 8]], '3')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: div must be a number

Naturally, divisions by zero are not allowed.

	>>> matrix_divided([[2, 4], [6, 8]], 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
